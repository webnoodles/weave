# WHAT TO HAVE:
- Something to Steal
- Something to be Killed
- Something to Kill You
- Different Paths
- Someone to Talk To
- Something to Experiment With
- Something the Players Probably Won’t Find

- A handful of named NPCs with goals and quirks to interact with.
- Potential allies for the more politically inclined players.
- Maybe even a third party beyond the party and the enemies.
- Relations between these NPCs in a sentence or two. A is hiding from B. C really hates D. E escaped from the prison run by F.
- Factions that these NPCs belong to. Actions will have long term consequences if factions are involved.
- Intelligent opposition. If the monsters are too stupid, no amount of trickery will help.
- If monsters are not intelligent, make them interesting. Slimes are more interesting than low-level undead because we’ve seen so many of those.
- Good looking maps. A good looking map appeals to the referee and says “Pick me! Pick me!”
- Notes on the map itself make it easier to get an overview of the place.
- Multiple entrances for players to choose from.
- Multiple exits for referees to append to.
- A map that suggests multiple goals. Rescue prisoner here, kill boss there, find hidden treasure over there. That adds replayability.
- A map key that is easy to skim by using _bold keywords_ for monsters and other stuff of prime importance to players.
- A setup that can be exploited in combat by tactically minded players. A bottleneck, a ledge, a bridge, a fortified position, a sally port.
- An opportunity to spy on enemies for the stealthily minded players. A murder hole, a grate, a tiny tunnel, a scrying ball.
- A map that could potentially work as the beginning of a campaign. It suggests greater things beyond its edge.
- Memorable magic items. A rod of thunder and lightning is better than a _something_ +1
- Stuff to interact with for players who like to experiment. Add suggestions for possible reactions.
- Traps that trick players such as finding amulets from a faction and the suggestion to wear them somewhere, and then realizing that an opposing faction built a trap for fools just like that.
- Opportunity for long-term change to the player characters. Getting a title, an extra arm, the blessing of a god, a fancy familiar.

# Character / Culture Generator
3 to 5 adjectives help create consistency
Picking 1 or 2 to be main characteristics reinforces consistency
Generating interesting characters withing a culture might mean going against the culture's adjectives.

i.e.:
Graerin: Militaristic, Pragmatic, Sly, Ambitious, Traditionalist
	 Commonfolk lieutenant: militaristic, pragmatic, non-ambitious
	 Lowborn noble revolutionary: ambitious, sly, non-traditionalist
