[[TTRPG Design]]

## Gnarled Grove

The challenge is the navigation of this labyrinthine root system, which has several areas it can lead to.
The illustration doesn't need to convey the actual paths between areas and which roots lead where, allowing for "true modularity", leaving it up to the GM how players reach which areas, and how many they want to use.
The local druids know these passages well, and use them as part of the grove's defenses, leading invaders around in circles and into possible danger.

Main illustration is that of a giant tree with loads of interconnected roots going down a cliff-like area - the roots are walkable/climbable and are extremely confusing to navigate.


## Shinsekai Yori "Reality Distortion"

The locals tell stories of a powerful evil entity that must be eliminated from a nearby abandoned fortress/palace, their very presence poisoning and distorting the land. They urge the adventurers to take a Holy Concoction with which to destroy this entity. When pressed for further information they'll show reluctance or feign ignorance.

In truth, the locals had been resorting to possession rituals that allowed them to tap into a powerful entity's power. The possessed would normally die/be disposed of after the fact, but this time they got away, and as such are "leaking" the entity's powers, causing unwanted chaos. The locals are unable to deal with the problem and do not wish to be discovered.
