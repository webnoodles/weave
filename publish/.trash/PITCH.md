Slide 1 - Who am I

- experienced with adobe suite
- 

Slide 2 - UX/UI Proposal


Slide 3 - Design Principles

Slide 4 - Colors, Fonts and Icons
- Assumptions made:
	- unspecified vehicle type for the futuristic racer -> went with gut and figured they'd be anti-gravity vehicles, inspired myself on Wipeout and Redout
- Background
	- didn't pick a random image off the internet because it would condition color palette options
	- opted for a quick vectorized rendition of an anti-grav racer and applied the color palette over it as a gradient

Slide 5 -  Typography
- Fugaz One:
	- impact with the thicker lines
	- rounded features makes it less aggressive on the eyes
- Geo Oblique
	- straight lines make it more futuristic
	-  thinner lines make it slicker
- Cuprum
	- complementary font for both cases
	- good for adding a bit of contrast between menu and sub-menu items

Slide 6 - Color Palette
- analogous color scheme
- total of 4 color options
- will work if picking any 3 of the colors in the palette

Slide 7 - Icons
- started out with a simpler/general test for the icons
- opted for the usage of hexagons to give it a more modern twist
- always work colorless into color to ensure they are always readable and scale well

Slide 8 - Warm Version

Slide 9 - Cold Version

Slide 10 - Benefits
- simple/minimalistic menus
- players won't feel lost and can get right into the action
- immersive into the futuristic setting

Slide 11 - Conclusion
- thank you for your time
